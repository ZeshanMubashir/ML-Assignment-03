# ML Assignment 03

This repository contains the code and documentation for Machine Learning Assignment 03. The objective of this assignment is to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset using a neural network-based model from the TensorFlow Keras library.

## Objectives

1. Classify the Fashion MNIST dataset items.
2. Plot the training and validation error and accuracy metrics.
3. Tune the model hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, number of neurons, activation functions, and input features.

## Deliverables

1. Well-commented code.
2. A document providing answers to the following questions:
   - What hyperparameters did you use to tune your model and why?
   - How did you plot the training and validation error and accuracy metrics?
3. A document detailing the collaboration within the group and the contributions of each member.
